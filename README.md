## 🎯 Mission

PDFMerge exists to provide students with free, reliable tools that support their educational journey. We believe that:

- **Education Should Be Free**: Students shouldn't have to pay for basic tools
- **Privacy Matters**: Your documents are personal and should remain private
- **Simplicity Works**: Tools should be easy to use and get the job done
